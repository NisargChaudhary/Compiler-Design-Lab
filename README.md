# Compiler Design Laboratory Practicals

## 📘 About This Repository
This repository contains the complete set of **Compiler Design (CD) Laboratory Practicals** implemented as per the university syllabus.  
The aim of these practicals is to understand the fundamental phases of a compiler, parsing techniques, and lexical analyzer generators using **C** and **LEX/Flex**.

All programs are written in a simple and understandable manner for:
- Lab examinations
- Viva preparation
- Concept clarity in Compiler Design
